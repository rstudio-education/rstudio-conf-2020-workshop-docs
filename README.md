# rstudio-conf-2020-workshop-docs

This repository contains documentation for instructors and TAs running workshops at rstudio::conf(2020). Much of this information has been communicated in email already, but this repository acts as an archive of those messages and other documentation associated with running the workshops.

I'll add links to Google Docs files when those are the single source of truth.
